        <p>The actual result is the same as the expected output. The main thing to consider is the fact that regardless the position where declared and defined in the scope, a variable is "hoisted" resulting in it being "undefined" if called before the definition.</p>

        <p>The expected sequence of values have been observed after code execution. The function "foo()" defines its own "z" and "x" variables in its scope that results in the outer variables with the same name to remain intact. Since a new "x" variable was declared during "hoisting" but not defined before calling the function "foo1()", it returned an "undefined" value.</p>
