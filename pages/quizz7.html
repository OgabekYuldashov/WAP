        <p>
            a. How many global variables we have?<br>
            -- 1 global variable! x = 10;
        </p>
        <p>
            b. Are there any closures in the code?<br>
            -- There is one closure: it is the inner function of function "f1". It is considered a closure because it has a reference to "arg2" parameter of f1 function. However, function "f1" does not create a closure since it has no free variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            c. What will be the outputs of the code?<br>
            -- "outer1" and 10.
        </p>
        <p>
            d. How will you call function f1 from outside the module?<br>
            -- A reference to "f1" function should be created inside an object and the object should be returned by the IIFE. For example: <code> return {f1: f1}</code>.

        <h1>4. explain why this is undefined.</h1>
        <img src="../img/q7task4.jpg">
        <p>
            As per the natural behavior of "arrow functions",<code>this</code> keyword is NON-BINDING, meaning "this" is not bound to anything at this stage. For this reason, the value is "undefined".
